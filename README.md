# Arboretum Admin App

Based off of the basic starter project for [Foundation for Sites 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites). It includes a Sass compiler and a starter HTML file for you.

## Installation and Setup

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.10 or greater)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

In order to get this thing running locally, clone it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites-template
```

then install the dependencies
```bash
cd arboretum-admin-dashboard
npm install
bower install
```

then you can run `npm start`, `foundation watch`, or `gulp serve` to run the Sass compiler. It will automatically re-run any time you edit a file.
